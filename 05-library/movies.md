# 🎬 Cinema & Cultural Growth

## 🎯 SMART Goal Statement
**Specific:** I will watch **12 high-quality films** in 2026 to cultivate visual literacy and explore different cultures and storytelling techniques. The selection will focus on Cult Classics, Award-winning Cinema, etc. rather than casual consumption.

**Measurable:**
- **Volume:** 12 Films (Target: 1 films per month).
- **Output:** Watch the film and add a short review to ./movie-reviews folder.

**Achievable:** A weekly "Movie Night" is a sustainable habit that provides high-quality relaxation without interfering with technical studies.

**Relevant:** Cinema is a powerful art form that reflects the human condition, fostering empathy and artistic growth for a **well-rounded individual**.

**Time-bound:**
- Complete the 12-film watchlist by December 31, 2026.
