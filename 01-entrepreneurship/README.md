# 💼 Build a Stream

## 🎯 SMART Goal Statement
**Specific:** I will design, develop, and publish a revenue-generating digital product (Mobile Game, Utility App, or Web Service) to establish a potential passive income stream independent of my main career.

**Measurable:**
- **Output:** Launch **1 functional MVP** (Minimum Viable Product) to a public marketplace (App Store, Play Store, or Web).
- **Monetization:** Successfully integrate a revenue model (Ads, Subscription, or One-time Purchase).
- **Financial:** Generate the **first revenue** (from 0 to 1) to validate the business model.

**Achievable:** I will strictly follow the **MVP Philosophy**—building the smallest functional version of the idea to test the market, preventing over-engineering and burnout.

**Relevant:** Gaining experience in the full product lifecycle (Idea -> Code -> Sales) is essential for financial freedom and engineering maturity.

**Time-bound:**
- **Launch Deadline:** The product will be live and capable of receiving payments by **December 31, 2026**.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 1: Ideation & Market Research (Jan - Apr)
*Goal: Find the problem/opportunity and define the platform.*
- [ ] **Research:** Investigate different markets (Mobile Games, Niche Web Tools, Productivity Apps) to find a "Blue Ocean" or a gap.
- [ ] **Decision:** Finalize the product type (Game vs. App vs. Web) and the tech stack (Unity, Flutter, React, etc.).
- [ ] **Prototype:** Create a low-fidelity prototype or "Proof of Concept" to test feasibility.

### Phase 2: Development & MVP (May - Aug)
*Goal: Build the core value proposition.*
- [ ] **Development:** Code the core features. Focus on function over form.
- [ ] **Validation:** Test the MVP with a small group of users or friends (Alpha testing).

### Phase 3: Monetization & Launch (Sep - Dec)
*Goal: Deploy and monetize.*
- [ ] **Integration:** Implement the revenue pipeline (AdMob, Stripe, IAP, etc.).
- [ ] **Deployment:** Handle stores/hosting (Play Store Console, AWS/Vercel, Domain).
- [ ] **Launch:** Publish the product and perform basic organic marketing to get the first user.
