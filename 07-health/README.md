# ⚡ Building a Machine

## 🎯 SMART Goal Statement
**Specific:** I will build a physique (target: 82kg) that is not just big, but highly functional. My training will rely on three pillars: **Calisthenics for technical mastery and body control (Skill)**, **Powerlifting for raw force (Strength)**, and **Zone 2 Cardio for metabolic efficiency (Endurance).**

**Measurable:**
- **Skill:** Acquire technical proficiency across the full spectrum of Calisthenics
- **Strength:** Reach **1.5x Bodyweight Squat**, **2x Bodyweight Deadlift**, and a **100kg Bench Press**.
- **Endurance:** Complete at least **60 minutes** of Zone 2 cardio per week.
- **Body:** Reach **82 kg** with visible abdominal definition (Lean Bulk).

**Achievable:** I will use "Concurrent Training" principles—dedicating the first 15-20 mins of every workout to "Technical Practice" (CNS fresh) before moving to heavy lifting.

**Relevant:** A well-rounded individual must be strong enough to lift heavy loads, agile enough to control their body in complex planes, and fit enough to endure.

**Time-bound:**
- Achieve all defined Strength, Skill, and Physique targets by **December 31, 2026**.
