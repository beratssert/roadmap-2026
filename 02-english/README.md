# 🌍 English Fluency

## 🎯 SMART Goal Statement
**Specific:** I will transform my "Passive Fluent" English skills into **active professional proficiency** by establishing a daily speaking routine and a weekly writing habit. I will focus on production rather than just consumption.

**Measurable:**
- **Speaking:** Complete 20 minutes of speaking practice daily (AI sessions + Shadowing).
- **Writing:** Write one "Weekly Progress Report" (150-300 words) every week and analyze it using AI feedback.
- **Progress:** Achieve a level where I can explain a complex technical concept or a philosophical idea fluently for 5 minutes without major pauses by the end of the year.

**Achievable:** The plan relies on "Micro-Habits" (20 mins/day) integrated into daily life, avoiding burnout while ensuring the "Compound Effect."

**Relevant:** English is a prerequisite for becoming a **well-rounded individual**. It is also an absolute necessity for being a **good engineer**.

**Time-bound:**
- **Quarterly Reviews:** Every 3 months to level up the difficulty.
- **Final Milestone:** December 31, 2026.
